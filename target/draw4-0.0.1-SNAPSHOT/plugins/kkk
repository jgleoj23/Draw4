\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hello is this Representative Sanford Bishop\
\
if so then \{\
Great, I\'92m Joseph Gardi and I\'92m a part of Wolf PAC Georgia, a political organization. I\'92m very concerned about the corruption in the federal government. I\'92m strongly against money in politics such as PACs. What is your position on this issue?\
\
if he likes it then \{\
Wolf PAC has a plan to resolve this growing problem with an amendment to the US constitution. Unfortunately the federal government is so corrupt that they wouldn\'92t even pass the disclosure act. The disclosure act makes it so that Super PACs aren\'92t secret anymore. Fortuanetely I trust you more than the federal government and article 5 of the constitution allows the states to amend the constitution independently of the federal government.\
\
We already have an idea for the amendment but we will discuss the amendment at the constitutional convention.\

\
if he hates it \{\
why?\
is there anything you want to do to fix the corruption?\
I hope that you take the time to investigate this further. After all 87% of people don\'92t like the money in politics. In addition, both California and Vermont have called for the constitutional convention. Please don\'92t let Georgia lag behind other states the way we did in the 19th amendment.}
